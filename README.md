# Data-Wrangling-with-MongoDB
In this course, we will explore how to wrangle data from diverse sources and shape it to 
enable data-driven applications. Some data scientists spend the bulk of their time doing this!

Students will learn how to gather and extract data from widely used data formats. 
They will learn how to assess the quality of data and explore best practices for data cleaning.
We will also introduce students to MongoDB, covering the essentials of storing data and the MongoDB query language 
together with exploratory analysis using the MongoDB aggregation framework.

This course is also a part of our Data Analyst Nanodegree.
